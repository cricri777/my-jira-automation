generate titles and descriptions for the tickets, creating a streamlined workflow to save time.

## Steps
1. Request LLM to generate a title/description for tickets.
2. Log the ticket to JIRA.
3. Log time to Tempo.
4. Enjoy 15 minutes of my time saved every working week ðŸ˜‚

- Python 3.10.11
- Packages: PyYAML, pip, requests, wheel
